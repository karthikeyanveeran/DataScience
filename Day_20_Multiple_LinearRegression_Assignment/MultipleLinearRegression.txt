Activity–Multiple Linear Regression
Learning outcomes: Multiple Linear Regression
After completing this exercise, you should be able to understand and perform below tasks.
	1. Building predictive model - Regression model using multiple linear regression technique.
	2. Validating the model results and optimizing the model.
	3. Evaluation of error metrics.
	4. Applying the model on un-seen data.
		a. Splitting data into train and test data sets.
		b. Comparing the error metrics.
	5. Interpretation of the results
	6. Handling multicollinearity and dimensionality reduction
	7. Stepwise Regression
Problem Statement:
A large child education toy company which sells edutainment tablets and gaming systems
both online and in retail stores wanted to analyze the customer data. They are operating
from last few years and maintaining all transactional information data. The given data
‘CustomerData.csv’ is a sample of customer level data extracted and processed for the
analysis from various set of transactional files.
The objectives of today’s activity are
Building a regression model to predict the customer revenue based on other factors
and understand the influence of other attributes on revenue
Steps:
Regression Model:
	1. Read the data ‘CustomerData.csv’ into R.
	2. Understand the structure of the data and pre-process
		a. Drop the attribute ‘CustomerID’
		b. Convert ‘City’ as factor variable
	3. Split the data into train and test data sets
		rows=seq(1,nrow(data),1)
		set.seed(123)
		trainRows=sample(rows,(70*nrow(data))/100)
		train = data[trainRows,]
		test = data[-trainRows,]
	4. Build linear regression and interpret the
		results #Input attributes by selection
		LinReg<-lm(TotalRevenueGenerated~City+NoOfChildren+
		Tenure+NoOfUnitsPurchased, data=train) summary(LinReg)
		#Input all attributes into model
		LinReg1<- lm(TotalRevenueGenerated ~ ., data=train)
		summary(LinReg1)
		# study the results of LinReg, LinReg1 models
	5. Error metrics evaluation on train data and test data
		library(DMwR)
		#Error verification on train data
		regr.eval(train$TotalRevenueGenerated,
		LinReg$fitted.values) #Error verification on test data
		Pred<-predict(LinReg,test)
		regr.eval(test$TotalRevenueGenerated, Pred)
	6. Spend the time on understanding the summary of the results and perform experiments 
	with multiple combinations of attributes (by dropping the attributes
	which are not significant)


II. Assignment:
Consider the dataset that depicts the wine-quality and its independent variables details.
	a. Read the data into R
	b. Do the required preprocessing steps
	c. Build the model with all the attributes and study the model and then decide the
	influencing attributes. Build the model with those selected attributes. Check the results.
	d. Split the dataset into train and test datasets
	e. Build the model with the selected attributes on train dataset
	f. Predict on train and test datasets
	g. Compute the error metrics on train and test datasets
